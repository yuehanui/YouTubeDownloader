# YouTubeDownloader


This is an application for downloading videos from YouTube in all available resolutions.

A lot of people trying to download 1080p or 4k videos from YouTube end up getting a silent video. The reason is that YouTube now codes the video and  audio seperately for anything over 720P. (That is also the reason why many online youtube downloading platform that used to support 1080p downloading only support 720p now.)

And most of the YouTube downloading platforms (both web-base and desktop app) that support 1080p+ suck. They either charge a fee or work at an intolerably slow speed.

This application allows you to download those videos at full speed and it is totally free from any subscription or Ad.



## Development

- [Python](https://www.python.org/).  An interpreted programming language.
- [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/). A powerful command-line program for downloading videos from YouTue and a few more website.
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/). A complete, cross-platform program to record, convert and stream audio & video.
- **Tkinter**. Pythonâ€˜s standard GUI toolkit

This application works by downloading the video and the audio saperately using **youtube-dl**, then using **FFmpeg** to merge the video and the audio. 



## Features
